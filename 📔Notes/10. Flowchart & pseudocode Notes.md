## Flowchart
A **flowchart** is a **visual representation** of a process, algorithm, or system using **symbols** to show the **sequence of steps** and **logical flow** of control.  
It’s a **graphical tool** that helps to **analyze, design, document, or manage** a process logically and systematically.

In simpler terms:  
A flowchart **shows what happens first, next, and last** in solving a problem or performing a task.

### ⚛️ Purpose of a Flowchart

- **Clarity:** Makes complex processes easy to understand.

- **Communication:** Helps developers, analysts, and stakeholders visualize logic.

- **Debugging:** Makes it easier to spot logical errors in an algorithm.

- **Documentation:** Acts as a visual record for software or process design.

- **Planning:** Used in the initial design phase before actual coding.

### 🧩 Key Components / Symbols Used in Flowcharts

### 📜 Rules for Drawing a Flowchart

1. Flowchart should **start** and **end** with a _Terminator_ symbol.

2. Use **arrows** to show the direction of flow.

3. Flow should generally move **top to bottom** or **left to right**.

4. Each step should be **clearly described** inside the symbol.

5. Avoid **crossing lines** or **ambiguous directions**.

6. Keep the design **simple and logical**.

7. Use **standardized symbols** consistently.

### 📚 Types of Flowcharts

1. **System Flowchart:** Shows the flow of data or processes in a system.

2. **Program Flowchart:** Represents the sequence of instructions in a program.

3. **Process Flowchart:** Shows the steps involved in a business or manufacturing process.

4. **Document Flowchart:** Tracks the flow of documents/information in a system.

5. **Data Flowchart:** Emphasizes how data moves between processes.

### 🔸 Example - Simple Flowchart for Finding the Largest Number

**Process:**

1. Start
    
2. Input A, B
    
3. Check if A > B
    
4. If true → Print “A is largest”
    
5. Else → Print “B is largest”
    
6. End

**Flow:**

```
+---------+
|  Start  |
+----+----+
     |
     v
+-------------+
| Input A, B  |
+------+------+
       |
       v
+----------------+
| A > B ?        |
+-------+--------+
       |Yes     |No
       v         v
+-----------+   +-----------+
| Print A   |   | Print B   |
+-----------+   +-----------+
       \         /
        \       /
         v     v
        +-------+
        |  End  |
        +-------+
```

### 👍 Advantages of Flowcharts

- Easy to **understand and communicate logic**.

- Helps in **systematic analysis and design**.

- Simplifies **debugging and maintenance**.

- Serves as a **training or reference document**.

- Encourages **modular programming**.

### 👎 Disadvantages of Flowcharts

- Time-consuming to draw for **complex programs**.

- Hard to **update** if process changes frequently.

- May become **large and messy** for big systems.

- Doesn’t show **detailed logic** like pseudocode can.

## Pseudocode
**Pseudocode** is a **plain-language description** of the steps in an algorithm or program, written in a **structured, code-like format**, but **not in any specific programming language**.

In short:

> **Pseudocode = Algorithm written in human-readable, programming-like form.**

It focuses on **logic and sequence**, not on syntax or compiler rules.

### ⚛️ Purpose of Pseudocode

- To **plan algorithms** before actual coding.

- To **communicate logic** clearly between programmers and non-programmers.

- To **bridge the gap** between a **flowchart** and **real code**.

- To **simplify debugging and understanding** of complex logic.

- To **save time** — it’s quicker to correct logic errors in pseudocode than in code.

### 📈 Characteristics of Good Pseudocode

- **Language independent** — not tied to any programming syntax.

- **Clear and unambiguous** — every step should be easy to interpret.

- **Structured** — uses indentation and control constructs properly.

- **Readable** — simple enough for anyone with basic logic skills to understand.

- **Stepwise refinement** — breaks down problems into smaller parts.

### 🧩 Basic Syntax & Structure
There’s no universal standard, but pseudocode often follows simple, readable conventions like these:

|Concept|Common Keywords/Format|Example|
|---|---|---|
|**Start/End**|`BEGIN`, `END`|`BEGIN ... END`|
|**Input/Output**|`READ`, `INPUT`, `PRINT`, `DISPLAY`|`READ X, Y`, `PRINT SUM`|
|**Assignment**|`←` or `=`|`SUM ← A + B`|
|**Decision (If-Else)**|`IF ... THEN ... ELSE ... ENDIF`|`IF A > B THEN PRINT A ELSE PRINT B ENDIF`|
|**Loop (For)**|`FOR i ← 1 TO n DO ... ENDFOR`|`FOR i ← 1 TO 10 DO PRINT i ENDFOR`|
|**Loop (While)**|`WHILE condition DO ... ENDWHILE`|`WHILE num > 0 DO ... ENDWHILE`|
|**Procedure/Function**|`PROCEDURE`, `FUNCTION`|`PROCEDURE FindMax(A, B)`|

### 🔸 Example - Find the Largest Number
**Problem:** Find the largest of two numbers A and B.

**Pseudocode:**

```
BEGIN
    READ A, B
    IF A > B THEN
        PRINT "A is the largest"
    ELSE
        PRINT "B is the largest"
    ENDIF
END
```

**Flow of Logic:**

- Start the process
    
- Take two inputs (A and B)
    
- Compare them using IF condition
    
- Print which one is larger
    
- End

### 👍 Advantages of Pseudocode

- **Simple to write and modify** — no syntax errors.

- **Encourages logical thinking** before coding.

- **Improves team communication**.

- **Easier to convert** into any programming language later.

- **Helps beginners** understand the structure of programs.

### 👎 Disadvantages of Pseudocode

- No **formal syntax**, so interpretation may vary.

- Can’t be **executed or tested** directly.

- Large algorithms may become **hard to follow**.

- Lacks visual representation (unlike flowcharts).

### 📜 Rules / Guidelines for Writing Pseudocode

1. Use **clear and consistent naming** for variables.

2. Each statement should **represent one logical action**.

3. Indent **nested structures** (loops, conditions) for clarity.

4. Avoid unnecessary detail — focus on logic, not syntax.

5. Start and end with **BEGIN** and **END** (or similar).

6. Keep the language **simple and human-readable**.

|Flowchart|Pseudocode|
|---|---|
|Graphical representation|Text-based representation|
|Uses shapes and arrows|Uses structured statements|
|Easy for visual learners|Easy for logical or text-based thinking|
|Time-consuming to modify|Quick to edit and test logic|
|Best for **conceptual design**|Best for **coding preparation**|
