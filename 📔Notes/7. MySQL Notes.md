## What is Database?
A **database** is a structured collection of data that is organized so it can be easily accessed, managed, and updated. Think of it as a digital filing system where information is stored in a way that software applications can quickly retrieve, add, modify, or delete data.

Key points:

- **Structured storage**: Data is organized in tables, rows, and columns (in relational databases) or in documents, key-value pairs, or graphs (in NoSQL databases).

- **Efficient retrieval**: Databases are optimized for searching, filtering, and aggregating data quickly.

- **Consistency and integrity**: They enforce rules so data remains accurate and reliable.

- **Multi-user access**: Multiple users or applications can read and write data concurrently without corruption.

- **Scalability**: A database can handle growth—more data, more users, or more requests—without breaking or slowing down. It’s a critical factor in real-world systems because data and traffic almost always grow over time.

- **Security**: Database can protect your data from unauthorized access, corruption, or loss.
	
	 Some ways for database to achieve that:
	 
	1. **Authentication & Authorization**
	    
	    - Only allow the right people or applications to access the database.
	    
	    - Example: A user logs in (authentication), and the system only lets them see their own data (authorization).
	
	2. **Encryption**
	    
	    - **At rest**: Data stored on disk is encrypted so attackers can’t read it if they get the files.
	    
	    - **In transit**: Data traveling over the network is encrypted to prevent eavesdropping.
	
	3. **Access Control & Privileges**
	    
	    - Limit what users or apps can do. For example, a reporting tool might only be able to read data, not delete it.
	
	4. **Auditing & Monitoring**
	    
	    - Track who accessed the database and what they did. This helps detect breaches or misuse quickly.
	
	5. **Backups & Recovery**
	    
	    - Even with strong security, mistakes or attacks happen. Regular backups let you restore data without catastrophic loss.
	
	6. **SQL Injection & Input Validation**
	    
	    - Protect against attacks where malicious users try to trick the database into executing harmful commands.

**Example:** A social media app uses a database to store user profiles, posts, likes, and comments. Without a database, it would be nearly impossible to manage this data efficiently.

## CRUD Operations
CRUD operations are the **basic actions you can perform on data in a database**. Every database—relational or NoSQL—supports them in some form. The acronym **CRUD** stands for:

1. **Create** – Add new data.
    
    - Example: Adding a new user to a social media app.
    
    - SQL example:
        
```sql
INSERT INTO users (name, email) VALUES ('Sankho', 'sankho@example.com');
```

2. **Read** – Retrieve or view existing data.
    
    - Example: Fetching a user’s profile or post.
    
    - SQL example:
        
```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE name='Sankho';
```

3. **Update** – Modify existing data.
    
    - Example: Changing a user’s email address.
    
    - SQL example:
        
```sql
UPDATE users SET email='newemail@example.com' WHERE name='Sankho';
```

4. **Delete** – Remove data.
    
    - Example: Deleting a user account.
    
    - SQL example:
        
```sql
DELETE FROM users WHERE name='Sankho';
```


In essence, **CRUD is the foundation of all database interactions**. If you master CRUD, you can handle almost any database task and start thinking about more advanced stuff like indexing, transactions, and optimization.

## SQL
SQL (**Structured Query Language**) is a programming language designed specifically for **managing and manipulating relational databases (RDBMS)**.

- **Relational databases** store data in **tables** (rows = records, columns = fields).

- SQL allows you to:
    
    - Retrieve data (`SELECT`)
    
    - Add data (`INSERT`)
    
    - Update data (`UPDATE`)
    
    - Delete data (`DELETE`)
    
    - Control access (`GRANT` / `REVOKE`)
    
    - Define database structure (`CREATE`, `ALTER`, `DROP`)

Think of SQL as **the language your database understands**. Without it, you can’t tell your database what to do.

### 🔑 Key SQL Components
SQL commands are grouped into **categories**:

#### a) DDL (Data Definition Language)
Deals with **structure** of the database (tables, schemas, indexes).

- `CREATE` – Make a new table or database
    
```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    email VARCHAR(100)
);
```

- `ALTER` – Change table structure
    
```sql
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN age INT;
```

- `DROP` – Delete table or database
	
```sql
DROP TABLE users;
```

#### b) DML (Data Manipulation Language)
Deals with  **CRUD operations** on data.

- `INSERT` – Add new records

- `SELECT` – Read data

- `UPDATE` – Modify existing data

- `DELETE` – Remove data

**Example:**

```sql
INSERT INTO users (name, email) VALUES ('Sankho', 'sankho@example.com');
SELECT * FROM users WHERE name='Sankho';
UPDATE users SET email='new@example.com' WHERE name='Sankho';
DELETE FROM users WHERE id=1;
```

#### c) DCL (Data Control Language)
Deals with **permissions and access control**.

- `GRANT` – Give permissions

- `REVOKE` – Remove permissions

Example:

```sql
GRANT SELECT, INSERT ON users TO 'app_user';
REVOKE DELETE ON users FROM 'app_user';
```

#### d) TCL (Transaction Control Language)
Deals with **transactions**—a set of operations treated as a single unit.

- `COMMIT` – Save changes permanently

- `ROLLBACK` – Undo changes

- `SAVEPOINT` – Set checkpoints within a transaction

Example:

```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE id = 1;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE id = 2;
COMMIT;
```

This ensures either **all changes happen or none**—critical for financial systems.

### ✍️ How SQL Works

1. **You write a query** (like `SELECT * FROM users`).

2. **Database engine parses it**—checks syntax and execution plan.

3. **Query optimizer** decides the fastest way to fetch data.

4. **Data is returned** in a structured table format.

SQL is **declarative**, not procedural. You **describe what you want**, not how to do it. The database engine figures out the best way.

### 💪Why SQL is Still Essential

Even with NoSQL, SQL is **the backbone of modern applications** because:

- It’s standardized, widely supported, and proven.

- Skills transfer across MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server, etc.

- Understanding relational thinking helps you design **efficient, reliable systems**.

## SQL v/s NoSQL

### 1. Data Model / Structure

|Feature|SQL (Relational)|NoSQL (Non-Relational)|
|---|---|---|
|Structure|Tables with **rows & columns**|Flexible: documents (JSON), key-value pairs, graphs, or wide-columns|
|Schema|Fixed schema (must define structure in advance)|Schema-less or dynamic (fields can vary between records)|
|Example|MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle|MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis, Neo4j|

**Takeaway:** SQL is strict and predictable; NoSQL is flexible and adapts to changing data.

### 2. Query Language

|Feature|SQL|NoSQL|
|---|---|---|
|Querying|Uses **SQL** (Structured Query Language)|Uses **API queries**, specific to the database (e.g., MongoDB uses JSON-like queries)|
|Complexity|Handles **complex joins, filters, aggregations** easily|Less ideal for complex multi-table relationships; optimized for **simple, fast operations**|

**Takeaway:** SQL is great for analytics and complex reporting; NoSQL is optimized for **speed and scale**.

### 3. Scalability

|Feature|SQL|NoSQL|
|---|---|---|
|Scaling|Vertical (upgrade a single server: CPU, RAM)|Horizontal (add more servers/nodes, easy to scale out)|
|Performance|Can slow down with huge data if not optimized|Handles massive traffic and huge datasets efficiently|

**Takeaway:** SQL can struggle with massive distributed systems; NoSQL thrives in large-scale, high-traffic apps.

### 4. Transactions & Consistency

|Feature|SQL|NoSQL|
|---|---|---|
|ACID Compliance|Fully ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability)|Often **eventually consistent**; some NoSQL (like MongoDB) now support ACID for limited use|
|Best For|Banking, finance, apps where data **accuracy is critical**|Social media feeds, caching, real-time analytics where **speed matters more than absolute consistency**|

### ✅ Examples of Use Cases

|SQL|NoSQL|
|---|---|
|Banking systems|Social media platforms|
|Inventory & ERP systems|Content management systems|
|E-commerce apps needing complex queries|Real-time analytics (IoT, gaming)|
|Applications needing strong relationships between tables|Big data, caching, recommendation engines|

### 🤝 Key Takeaways

1. **SQL = Structured & Reliable**
    
    - Use when data is structured, relationships matter, and consistency is critical.

2. **NoSQL = Flexible & Scalable**
    
    - Use when data is unstructured, schema evolves, or you need horizontal scalability.

3. **Modern Apps Often Use Both (Polyglot Persistence)**
    
    - Example: A social media app may use SQL for user accounts and NoSQL for posts, feeds, and caching.

## DBMS
**DBMS** stands for **Database Management System**. It’s **software that lets you create, manage, and interact with databases** efficiently and securely.

Think of it as the **middle layer between the database (data storage) and users/applications**—it handles all the complexity so you don’t have to deal with raw data files manually.

### 💼 Core Functions of a DBMS

1. **Data Storage, Retrieval & Update**
    
    - Handles storing data on disk, retrieving it, and modifying it safely.

2. **Data Security & Access Control**
    
    - Ensures only authorized users can access or modify data.

3. **Data Integrity & Consistency**
    
    - Enforces rules (like primary keys, foreign keys, constraints) to prevent invalid or inconsistent data.

4. **Backup & Recovery**
    
    - Automatically manages backups and restores data if something goes wrong.

5. **Transaction Management**
    
    - Supports **ACID properties** (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) for safe multi-step operations.

6. **Concurrency Control**
    
    - Handles multiple users accessing or modifying data simultaneously without conflicts.

### 🧩 Types of DBMS

1. **Relational DBMS (RDBMS)**
    
    - Data stored in **tables with rows & columns**
    
    - Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle
    
    - Uses SQL

2. **NoSQL DBMS**
    
    - Data stored in flexible formats: documents, key-value pairs, graphs, columns
    
    - Examples: MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis
    
    - Often schema-less

3. **Hierarchical DBMS**
    
    - Data stored in a **tree-like structure**
    
    - Example: IBM IMS

4. **Network DBMS**
    
    - Data stored in **graphs with nodes and relationships**
    
    - Example: IDMS

### 💪 Why DBMS Is Important

- Without a DBMS, managing large datasets is chaotic and error-prone.

- DBMS provides **efficiency, security, and consistency**.

- It’s the backbone of almost every modern software application—from web apps to banking systems.

## Database Queries
Some Basic Database Queries:

### 1. Creating Databases

```mysql
# Creating a database
CREATE DATABASE demo_db;

# IF NOT EXISTS keyword
# If the data base not exists then it will create the database & if the database is already existsthen it will only throw a warning and the exicution will go on.
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS instagram; /* This will create one. */
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS instagram; /* This will just throw a warning */
```

### 2. Deleting Databases

```mysql
# Deleting a database
DROP DATABASE demo_db;

# IF EXISTS keyword
# IF the data base exists then this command will delete the database & if the database doesn't exists then it will only throw the warning.
DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS instagram; /* This will delete the database */
DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS instagram; /* This will only throw a warning */
```

### 3. Seeing Databases

```mysql
# Seeing all databases
SHOW DATABASES;
```

### 4. Selecting a Database

```mysql
# Selecting a database
USE college;
```

---

## Tables
In **MySQL**, a **table** is the **fundamental structure where data is stored**. You can think of it like a spreadsheet: it has **rows** and **columns**, where each row represents a single record, and each column represents a field or attribute of that record.

### Structure of a Table

- **Columns (Fields/schema)**: Define the type of data stored, e.g., `id`, `name`, `email`.

- **Rows (Records)**: Each row stores a single instance of data.

- **Example Table: `users`**
	
|id|name|email|age|
|---|---|---|---|
|1|Sankho| sankho@mail.com |21|
|2|Riya| riya@mail.com |22|
	
- Here, `id`, `name`, `email`, `age` are **columns**.
	
- Each row is a **record**.

---

## Table Queries
**Table queries** in MySQL are the SQL commands you use to **create, modify, view, or remove tables**. These don’t just deal with data (rows) but with the **structure** of the database itself.

Here’s a complete breakdown:

### Create a Table

#### Syntax:

![[Screenshot From 2025-08-17 19-01-46.png]]

#### Datatypes:

##### 1. Numeric Data Types

Used for numbers (integers, decimals, etc.).

- **INT / INTEGER** → Whole numbers (−2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647)

- **TINYINT** → Very small numbers (−128 to 127) → often used for `BOOLEAN` (0/1).

- **SMALLINT** → Small numbers (−32,768 to 32,767).

- **MEDIUMINT** → Medium numbers (−8 million to 8 million).

- **BIGINT** → Very large numbers (up to ±9 quintillion).

- **DECIMAL(M,D)** → Exact numbers with decimals (e.g., money values).
    
    - Example: `DECIMAL(10,2)` → max 10 digits, 2 after decimal (99999999.99).

- **FLOAT / DOUBLE** → Approximate decimals (faster but less precise than DECIMAL).

##### 2. String (Text) Data Types
Used for storing words, characters, and text.

- **CHAR(N)** → Fixed-length string (e.g., `CHAR(5)` always stores 5 chars, padding with spaces).

- **VARCHAR(N)** → Variable-length string (max length N, saves space). Most common for names, emails.

- **TEXT** → Large text. Comes in variations:
    
    - `TINYTEXT` → up to 255 chars
    
    - `TEXT` → up to 65,535 chars
    
    - `MEDIUMTEXT` → up to 16 million chars
    
    - `LONGTEXT` → up to 4 billion chars

- **ENUM** → Fixed set of values (like categories).

```mysql
gender ENUM('Male', 'Female', 'Other')
```

- **SET** → Stores multiple values from a predefined set.

##### 3. Date & Time Data Types
Used for storing timestamps, dates, etc.

- **DATE** → Stores only date (`YYYY-MM-DD`)

- **TIME** → Stores only time (`HH:MM:SS`)

- **DATETIME** → Stores both date + time (`YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`)

- **TIMESTAMP** → Similar to `DATETIME`, but auto-updates with current time (useful for created_at, updated_at fields).

- **YEAR** → Stores year (e.g., `2025`).

##### 4. Binary Data Types
Used for files, images, or raw data.

- **BLOB** (Binary Large Object): stores binary data.
    
    - `TINYBLOB`, `BLOB`, `MEDIUMBLOB`, `LONGBLOB` depending on size.
    
    - Example: storing an image file inside the database.

##### 5. JSON Data Type (MySQL 5.7+)

- Stores JSON documents.

- Useful for semi-structured data (e.g., configs, dynamic attributes).

Example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE products (
   id INT PRIMARY KEY,
   details JSON
);
```

Then you can query parts of JSON with MySQL functions.

##### ✅ Summary Table of Common Data Types

|Category|Common Types|
|---|---|
|Numeric|INT, BIGINT, DECIMAL, FLOAT, DOUBLE|
|String|CHAR, VARCHAR, TEXT, ENUM|
|Date/Time|DATE, TIME, DATETIME, TIMESTAMP|
|Binary|BLOB (for images/files)|
|Special|JSON|

#### Constraints:
In **MySQL**, **constraints** are rules you apply to table columns to **control the type of data allowed**, ensuring **accuracy, integrity, and consistency**.

 **Types of Constraints in MySQL**:

##### 🔹 NOT NULL

- Ensures a column **cannot be empty**.
	
```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL
);
```

➡️ Here, every user **must** have a name.

##### 🔹 DEFAULT

- Provides a **default value** if none is specified.
    
```sql
CREATE TABLE orders (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'pending'
);
```

➡️ If no `status` is given, it automatically becomes `'pending'`.

##### 🔹 UNIQUE

- Ensures all values in a column are **different** (no duplicates).
    
```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE
);
```

➡️ No two employees can have the same email.

##### 🔹 PRIMARY KEY

- **Unique + Not Null**, identifies each row in a table.

- Usually applied to `id` columns.
	
```sql
CREATE TABLE students (
    student_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50)
);
```

➡️ Each student is uniquely identified by `student_id`.

##### 🔹 AUTO_INCREMENT

- Automatically generates a **sequential number** for each new row.
    
```sql
CREATE TABLE products (
    product_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    name VARCHAR(50)
);
```

➡️ New products automatically get IDs: 1, 2, 3…

##### 🔹 FOREIGN KEY

- Creates a **relationship between two tables**.

- Ensures the value exists in another table (referential integrity).
    
```sql
CREATE TABLE orders (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    user_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id)
);
```

➡️ `user_id` in `orders` must exist in the `users` table.

##### 🔹 CHECK (MySQL 8.0+)

- Ensures values meet a condition.
    
```sql
CREATE TABLE accounts (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    balance DECIMAL(10,2) CHECK (balance >= 0)
);
```

➡️ Balance cannot be negative.

##### 🔹 INDEX (not exactly a constraint, but related)

- Improves speed of queries (not about validity, but about performance).
    
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_name ON users(name);
```

##### ✅ Summary of MySQL Constraints

- `NOT NULL` → must have value

- `DEFAULT` → auto-fill value

- `UNIQUE` → no duplicates

- `PRIMARY KEY` → unique + not null

- `AUTO_INCREMENT` → auto ID generation

- `FOREIGN KEY` → links between tables

- `CHECK` → validates conditions

#### Example:

```mysql
use college;

CREATE TABLE teacher (
  id INT UNIQUE ,
  name VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
  subject VARCHAR(30) DEFAULT "supp",
  stu_no INT DEFAULT 0,
  salary INT UNSIGNED,
  age INT,
  experience FLOAT,
  CONSTRAINT qualification CHECK (age>=30 AND experience >= 5 AND age < 60),
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
);
```

#### Primary Key:
A **Primary Key** is one of the **most important constraints** in MySQL (and relational databases in general). It uniquely identifies every row (record) in a table.

##### 🔶 Key Characteristics

- **Uniqueness** → No two rows can have the same primary key value.

- **Not Null** → A primary key column cannot have `NULL`.

- **One per table** → Each table can have **only one primary key** (but it can be made of multiple columns → _composite key_).

- **Indexing** → MySQL automatically creates an index on the primary key, making lookups faster.

##### 🔶 Example: Single Column Primary Key

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE
);
```

- `id` is the **primary key**.

- It uniquely identifies each user.

- `AUTO_INCREMENT` makes MySQL assign IDs automatically (1, 2, 3…).

##### 🔶 Example: Composite Primary Key
When uniqueness depends on more than one column.

```sql
CREATE TABLE enrollment (
    student_id INT,
    course_id INT,
    PRIMARY KEY (student_id, course_id)
);
```

- Here, a student can enroll in many courses, and a course can have many students.

- But the combination `(student_id, course_id)` must be unique.

##### 🔶 Why Primary Key is Important

- Prevents **duplicate rows**.

- Acts as a **reference point for foreign keys** in other tables.

- Ensures **data integrity** (no two rows can represent the same entity).

#### Foreign Key:
A **Foreign Key** in MySQL is a column (or set of columns) in one table that **references the Primary Key in another table**. It creates a **link (relationship)** between the two tables and ensures **referential integrity** (no orphaned or invalid references).

##### 🔷 Key Characteristics

- A **foreign key** points to a **primary key** (or unique key) in another table.

- Ensures that values in the child table **must exist in the parent table**.

- Prevents invalid data (e.g., you can’t assign an order to a non-existent user).

- Supports **cascading actions** (update/delete rules).

##### 🔷 Example: Foreign Key in Action
Let’s model a simple system: **Users and Orders**.

```sql
-- Parent Table
CREATE TABLE users (
    user_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL
);

-- Child Table
CREATE TABLE orders (
    order_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    user_id INT,
    product VARCHAR(100),
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(user_id)
);
```

How this works:

- Each `order` must be linked to a valid `user`.

- If you try to insert an order with a `user_id` that doesn’t exist in `users`, MySQL will reject it.

##### 🔷 Cascading Actions
When the parent row changes, what happens to the child rows? You can control this with **ON DELETE** and **ON UPDATE**.

```sql
CREATE TABLE orders (
    order_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    user_id INT,
    product VARCHAR(100),
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(user_id)
        ON DELETE CASCADE
        ON UPDATE CASCADE
);
```

Options:

- **CASCADE** → Delete/update child rows automatically when parent is deleted/updated.

- **SET NULL** → Set the foreign key column to `NULL` if parent is deleted.

- **RESTRICT / NO ACTION** → Prevent deletion/update if child rows exist (default).

#### Difference b/w Primary and Foreign key

```mysql
# Primary Key
	# It is a column (or set of columns) in a table that uniquely identifies 		each row. (a unique id)
	# There is only 1 PK & it should be NOT null.

# Foreign Key
	# A foreign key is a column (or set of columns) in a table that refers to 		the primary key in another table.
	# FKs can have duplicate & null values.
	# There can be multiple FKs.
```

---

### Inserting in the Table

#### ✅ Basic Syntax

```sql
INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, column3, ...)
VALUES (value1, value2, value3, ...);
```

#### ✅ Example
Suppose we have a `users` table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,
    age INT
);
```

#### ✍️ Insert a single row:

```sql
INSERT INTO users (name, email, age)
VALUES ('Sankho', 'sankho@mail.com', 21);
```

- Here we **don’t insert `id`** because it’s `AUTO_INCREMENT`.

#### ✍️ Insert Multiple Rows

```sql
INSERT INTO users (name, email, age)
VALUES 
('Riya', 'riya@mail.com', 22),
('Amit', 'amit@mail.com', 23),
('Sara', 'sara@mail.com', 20);
```

➡️ More efficient than inserting one row at a time.

#### 🫴 Insert Without Column List
If you provide values for **all columns in exact order**, you can skip the column list.

```sql
INSERT INTO users VALUES (NULL, 'John', 'john@mail.com', 25);
```

- `NULL` is used for `AUTO_INCREMENT` column so MySQL assigns the next number.

==⚠️ **Warning:** This is risky if table structure changes. Always better to list columns explicitly.==

#### ✍️ Insert Using Default Values
If a column has a **DEFAULT** constraint, you can skip it.

```sql
CREATE TABLE orders (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    product VARCHAR(50),
    status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'pending'
);

INSERT INTO orders (product) VALUES ('Laptop');
```

➡️ Status automatically becomes `'pending'`.

#### 🤝 Insert Data from Another Table

```sql
INSERT INTO archive_users (id, name, email, age)
SELECT id, name, email, age FROM users WHERE age > 21;
```

➡️ Copies users older than 21 into `archive_users`.

---

### Seeing the Tables

#### Show All Tables in the Current Database

```mysql
USE user;
SHOW TABLES;
```

➡️ Lists all tables in the database you’re currently using.

#### See Sample Data from a Table

```mysql
# selects add show data from database
select * from teacher;
select id,name from teacher;
```

#### Clauses
The `SELECT` statement is used to retrieve data from a database. Clauses are additional keywords that modify or filter the result of the query.

##### 1. FROM

- Defines the table(s) from which data will be fetched.
	
```sql
SELECT column1, column2
FROM table_name;
```

##### 2. WHERE

- Filters rows based on a condition.
	
```mysql
# Where clause : To define some conditions
SELECT name, age FROM userInfo 
WHERE age > 15;
```

==Disclaimer: We can't use aggregate function with Where clause, in those case we have to use subqueries.==

 📘 **Operators in `WHERE` Clause**
The `WHERE` clause is used to filter records based on a condition. Operators define how the filtering is applied.

###### **1. Arithmetic Operators**
Used to check values using mathematics.

- `+` → Addition

- `-` → Subtraction

- `*` → Multiplication

- `/` → Division

- `%` → Modulo (Remainder)

```mysql
# Arithmetic Operator: +, -, *, /, %
SELECT name,age FROM userInfo 
WHERE age + 1 = 17;
```

###### **2. Comparison Operators**
Used to compare values.

- `=` → Equal to

- `!=` or `<>` → Not equal to

- `>` → Greater than

- `<` → Less than

- `>=` → Greater than or equal to

- `<=` → Less than or equal to

```sql
# Comparison Operator: =, !=, <, >, <=, >=
SELECT name, followers FROM userInfo 
WHERE followers <= 400;
```

###### **3. Logical Operators**

Used to combine multiple conditions.

- `AND` → All conditions must be true

- `OR` → At least one condition must be true

- `NOT` → Negates a condition

- `BETWEEN` → Checks if a value lies within a range (inclusive)

- `IN` → Checks if a value matches any value in a list

```mysql
# Logical Operator: AND, OR, NOT, IN, BETWEEN
SELECT
	name,
	age,
	followers
FROM
	userInfo
WHERE
	age > 15
	AND follow <300;
SELECT name, age, follow FROM userInfo 
WHERE age > 15 OR follow <300;
SELECT name, age, follow FROM userInfo 
WHERE NOT (age > 15 OR follow <300);

	# Some new keywords
SELECT name, followers FROM userInfo 
WHERE age BETWEEN 14 AND 16;
SELECT name, email FROM userInfo 
WHERE email IN ("bob123@gmail.com","mikeBoss@yam.com", "mymail@yahoo.com");
	#If no match is found then sql will skip that.
```

###### **4. LIKE**
Used for pattern matching (with wildcards).

- `%` → Matches zero or more characters

- `_` → Matches exactly one character

```mysql
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE name LIKE 'A%';   # names starting with A
```

###### **5. IS NULL / IS NOT NULL**
Checks if a column has `NULL` value.

```mysql
SELECT * FROM orders
WHERE delivery_date IS NULL;
```

###### **6. ANY / ALL**
Used with subqueries.

- `ANY` → True if condition matches **at least one** value in the subquery

- `ALL` → True if condition matches **all** values in the subquery

```mysql
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE salary > ANY (SELECT salary FROM employees WHERE department = 'HR');
```

###### **7. EXISTS**
Returns true if the subquery returns one or more rows.

```mysql
SELECT * FROM customers c
WHERE EXISTS (SELECT * FROM orders o WHERE c.id = o.customer_id);
```

###### **8. Bitwise Operators**

|Operator|Meaning|Typical Use in `WHERE`|
|---|---|---|
|`&`|Bitwise AND|Test if specific bit(s) are set|
|`|`|Bitwise OR|
|`^`|Bitwise XOR|Check if bits differ|
|`~`|Bitwise NOT|Test for bit(s) **not** set (via complement)|
|`<<`|Left shift|Build dynamic masks (`1 << n`)|
|`>>`|Right shift|Inspect higher-order bits|

##### 3. DISTINCT

- Removes duplicate rows from the result.
    
```mysql
SELECT DISTINCT country
FROM customers;
```

##### 4. ORDER BY

- Sorts the result set in ascending (`ASC`, default) or descending (`DESC`) order.
    
```mysql
# Order By Clause: Sort the table in ascending (ASC) or descending(DESC) order
SELECT name, follow, id FROM userInfo 
ORDER BY follow ASC;

SELECT name, follow, id FROM userInfo 
ORDER BY follow DESC;

# If not specified then by default it will sort in ASC order.
SELECT * FROM userInfo 
ORDER BY name;
```

##### 5. GROUP BY

- Groups rows that have the same values in specified columns.

- Often used with aggregate functions (`COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MAX`, `MIN`).

```mysql
# Group by Clause: Groups rows that have the same values into summary rows. It collects data from multiple records and groups the result by one or more column.

SELECT age FROM userInfo
GROUP BY age;
```

##### 6. HAVING

- Filters groups created by `GROUP BY`.

- Similar to `WHERE`, but applied **after grouping**.

```mysql
# Having clause: Similar to Where i.e. applies some condition on rows but, it is used when we want to apply any condition after grouping.

# WHERE is for the table, HAVING is for a group
# Grouping is necessary for HAVING

SELECT age, max(followers) FROM userInfo
GROUP BY age
HAVING max(followers) > 400
ORDER BY age;
```

##### 7. LIMIT

- Restricts the number of rows returned.
    
```mysql
SELECT *
FROM products
LIMIT 10;
```

##### 8. OFFSET

- Skips a specific number of rows before returning results (used with `LIMIT`).
    
```mysql
SELECT *
FROM products
LIMIT 10 OFFSET 5;
```

---

##### ⚡ Execution Order of SELECT Clauses

The logical order in which MySQL processes a `SELECT` query:

```mysql
# General Order:

# SELECT column(s)
# FROM table_name
# WHERE condition
# GROUP BY column(s)
# HAVING condition
# ORDER BY column(s) ASC;
```

---

#### Aggregate Functions

Aggregate functions perform calculations on a set of rows and return **a single value**.  
They’re often used with `GROUP BY` to group rows before applying the function.

**🔑 Common Aggregate Functions**

##### 1. COUNT()

- Returns the number of rows (non-NULL values if a column is specified).
    
```mysql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_students
FROM students;

SELECT COUNT(age) AS known_ages
FROM students;
```

##### 2. SUM()

- Returns the total sum of a numeric column.
    
```mysql
SELECT SUM(salary) AS total_salary
FROM employees;
```

##### 3. AVG()

- Returns the average value of a numeric column.
    
```mysql
SELECT AVG(marks) AS avg_marks
FROM students;
```

##### 4. MIN()

- Returns the smallest value in a column.
    
```mysql
SELECT MIN(price) AS cheapest_item
FROM products;
```

##### 5. MAX()

- Returns the largest value in a column.
    
```mysql
SELECT MAX(price) AS most_expensive
FROM products;
```

##### 6. GROUP_CONCAT() (MySQL-specific)

- Concatenates values from a group into a single string.
    
```sql
SELECT department, GROUP_CONCAT(name) AS employees
FROM staff
GROUP BY department;
```

##### ⚡ Usage with GROUP BY
Aggregate functions are often paired with `GROUP BY` to calculate values per group.

```sql
SELECT department, COUNT(*) AS total_emp, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department;
```

##### ⚠️ Key Points to Remember

- `WHERE` filters rows **before** aggregation.

- `HAVING` filters rows **after** aggregation.

```sql
-- Only show departments with more than 5 employees
SELECT department, COUNT(*) 
FROM employees
GROUP BY department
HAVING COUNT(*) > 5;
```

- Aggregate functions **ignore NULL values** (except `COUNT(*)`, which counts all rows).

---

### Updating into the Table
The `UPDATE` statement is used to modify existing records (rows) in a table.

#### 🔑 Syntax

```mysql
UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...
[WHERE condition]
[LIMIT n];
```

- **UPDATE table_name** → The table to be updated.

- **SET** → Defines which columns to update and their new values.

- **WHERE** (optional but important!) → Specifies which rows should be updated. Without `WHERE`, **all rows** in the table will be updated.

- **LIMIT** (optional) → Restricts how many rows get updated (useful for testing or safety).

#### ✅ Example

```Mysql
# Update Command: to update in existing rows
UPDATE userInfo
SET follow = 150
WHERE age = 15;
SELECT * FROM userInfo;

# Teacher said that if we run update command form the first time then there will be error & we have to run 
# SET SQL_SAFE_UPDATE = 0; but, I guess I don't need it beacuse i am in linux.
```

---

### Deleting Data from Table
The `DELETE` statement is used to **remove existing rows** from a table.

#### 🔑 Syntax

```sql
DELETE FROM table_name
[WHERE condition]
[LIMIT n];
```

- **DELETE FROM table_name** → Specifies the table from which rows will be deleted.

- **WHERE** (optional but critical) → Defines which rows to delete. Without `WHERE`, **all rows** are deleted.

- **LIMIT** (optional) → Restricts the number of rows deleted (useful for large datasets or testing).

#### ✅ Example

```Mysql
# Delete Command: to delete existing rows
DELETE FROM posts 
WHERE id = 102;
SELECT * FROM posts;

# Disclaimer: If we don't any type of condition then it will delete all rows... Be careful.
```

---

### Altering the Tables
The `ALTER` command is used to **modify the structure of an existing table** (schema changes).

#### 🔑 Syntax

```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name
[alter_specification];
```

#### Common Alter Operations

##### 1. Add a new column

```mysql
ALTER TABLE students
ADD address VARCHAR(100);
```

##### 2. Add multiple columns

```mysql
ALTER TABLE students
ADD phone VARCHAR(15),
ADD dob DATE;
```

##### 3. Modify an existing column

- Change data type, size, or constraints.
    
```mysql
ALTER TABLE employees
MODIFY salary DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL;
```

##### 4. Change column name (RENAME COLUMN)

```mysql
ALTER TABLE employees
CHANGE COLUMN fullname name VARCHAR(100);
```

##### 5. Drop a column

```mysql
ALTER TABLE students
DROP COLUMN address;
```

##### 6. Rename a table

```mysql
ALTER TABLE orders
RENAME TO customer_orders;
```

##### 7. Add a constraint

```mysql
ALTER TABLE employees
ADD CONSTRAINT chk_salary CHECK (salary > 0);
```

##### 8. Drop a constraint

```mysql
ALTER TABLE employees
DROP CONSTRAINT chk_salary;
```

##### 9. Add an index

```mysql
ALTER TABLE employees
ADD INDEX idx_name (name);
```

##### 10. Drop an index

```mysql
ALTER TABLE employees
DROP INDEX idx_name;
```

#### ⚠️ Important Notes

- **ALTER modifies structure, not data.**

- Operations like dropping columns/constraints are **destructive** — data can be lost.

- Some alterations lock the table until the operation completes.

- Use cautiously on large tables in production — schema changes can be expensive.

---

### Trancating Table Data 
The `TRUNCATE` command is a **DDL (Data Definition Language)** statement used to **remove all rows** from a table instantly.  
Unlike `DELETE`, it does not delete rows one by one.

#### 🔑 Syntax

```sql
TRUNCATE TABLE table_name;
```

#### 🔍 Key Characteristics

- **Removes all rows** from a table.

- **Resets AUTO_INCREMENT** counter (back to 1).

- Cannot use `WHERE` (all rows are always removed).

- Faster than `DELETE` because it deallocates data pages instead of logging each row deletion.

- Considered a **DDL operation** (internally performs a `DROP` + `CREATE` on the table).

#### ✅ Example

```sql
TRUNCATE TABLE orders;
```

👉 This removes all rows from `orders` and resets any auto-increment columns.

#### ⚠️ Important Notes

- **Irreversible**: Once truncated, data cannot be recovered (unless backups exist).

- Cannot be used if the table is referenced by a **foreign key constraint**.

- Requires **DROP privileges** (not just DELETE privileges).

- Much faster than `DELETE` for large tables.

#### 🔄 TRUNCATE vs DELETE vs DROP

|Command|Removes Rows|Can Use WHERE|Resets Auto-Increment|Table Structure Remains|Speed|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|**DELETE**|Yes (row by row)|✅ Yes|❌ No|✅ Yes|Slower|
|**TRUNCATE**|Yes (all rows)|❌ No|✅ Yes|✅ Yes|Faster|
|**DROP**|Entire table|❌ No|❌ N/A|❌ No (table removed)|Fastest|

## 💪 Important

```mysql
# Problem: Aggregate function & Group by clause can fetch specific data but they can't use that in a informative format... i.e - We acn't find the max followers row but can't access the name... That's w euse these two togather for better result.

# Q: Print a table names and maximum followers which is sorted by ASC order into deferent group.
SELECT age, name, max(followers) FROM userInfo
GROUP BY age
ORDER BY age;

# It's a trick question from teacher, We still can't fetch any coloumn outside Group by clause & aggregate function
# Here, followers is in aggregate function & age is in Group by clause so, they are valid but, name is not mention ether of this.

# in SQL, if we pass the name with followers and age then there are multiple names in same age group so, SQL have to use a complex table to show the data... But it doesn't have that so, it throws error.

# Solution:
SELECT u.age. u.name, u.followers
FROM userInfo u
WHERE u.followers = (
	SELECT max(f.followers)
	FROM userInfo f
	WHERE u.age = f.age
);
```

---

## Advanced SQL Topics

### 1. `UPDATE ... JOIN`

Update rows in one table using data from another table.

```sql
UPDATE employees e
JOIN departments d ON e.dept_id = d.id
SET e.salary = e.salary * 1.1
WHERE d.name = 'Sales';
```

---

### 2. `DELETE` with JOIN

Delete rows using conditions from another table.

```sql
DELETE p
FROM posts p
JOIN users u ON p.user_id = u.id
WHERE u.status = 'inactive';
```

---

### 3. Reset AUTO_INCREMENT with ALTER

```sql
ALTER TABLE users AUTO_INCREMENT = 1;
```

---

### 4. TRUNCATE with Foreign Keys

MySQL prevents truncation if a table has foreign keys. You can temporarily disable checks:

```sql
SET FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS = 0;
TRUNCATE TABLE child_table;
SET FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS = 1;
```

---

### 5. Transaction Control Example

```sql
START TRANSACTION;
DELETE FROM accounts WHERE balance < 0;
ROLLBACK; -- undo if mistake
```

---

### 6. Views

A **View** is a virtual table based on a query.

```sql
CREATE VIEW active_users AS
SELECT id, name, email
FROM users
WHERE status = 'active';
```

---

### 7. Stored Procedures (Basics)

Reusable SQL blocks stored in the database.

```sql
DELIMITER //
CREATE PROCEDURE getUsers()
BEGIN
    SELECT * FROM users;
END //
DELIMITER ;
```

Call the procedure:

```sql
CALL getUsers();
```

🔹 Beginner Level (Warm-up)

1. Create a table `Library` with columns: `book_id`, `title`, `author`, `price`, `copies`.
    
    - Insert at least 5 sample rows.

2. Select all books priced above 500.

3. Find the total number of books in the library.

4. Update the number of copies for one book.

5. Delete a book whose price is less than 200.

🔹 Intermediate Level (Clauses + Aggregates)

1. Create a table `Employee` with columns: `id`, `name`, `department`, `salary`. Insert 6–7 rows with mixed departments.
  
2. Select employees who work in “IT” or “HR”.

3. Find the average salary of employees department-wise.

4. Find the employee(s) who earn the maximum salary in each department.

5. Increase all employees’ salary by 15%.

🔹 Advanced Level (Grouping + Having + Subqueries)

1. Create a table `Orders` with: `order_id`, `customer_name`, `city`, `amount`. Insert 10 rows with varying cities and amounts.

2. Find customers who spent more than 2000 in total.

3. Get the city with the maximum total order amount.
   
4. Select customers who spent **above average order amount**.
   
5. Assign categories:
    
    - amount > 2000 → "Platinum"
     
    - 1000–2000 → "Gold"
     
    - <1000 → "Silver"

🔹 Pro Level (Joins + Real Use Cases)

1. Create two tables:
    
    - `Students(roll_no, name, class_id)`
    
    - `Classes(class_id, subject, teacher)`  
        Insert 5 students and 3 classes.

2. Write a query to list all students with their subject and teacher.
   
3. Find students who don’t have a class assigned.
   
4. Find the subject with the most students enrolled.
   
5. Delete a class and check what happens to students (use `ON DELETE CASCADE` vs `ON DELETE SET NULL` and observe the difference).
