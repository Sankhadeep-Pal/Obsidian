# .desktop File

## What is .desktop file?
Think of a .desktop file as the ID card for your software, Sankho. It’s a small text file that tells your operating system—specifically the Desktop Environment like KDE Plasma—everything it needs to know about an application so it can show it in a menu or a launcher like Rofi.

Without a .desktop file, an application is just a lonely "binary" file sitting in a folder. With it, the application becomes a searchable, clickable tool with a name and a pretty icon.
