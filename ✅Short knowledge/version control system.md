# Version Control System

A **Version Control System (VCS)** is a tool that helps manage changes to source code or documents over time. It allows multiple people to collaborate, track revisions, and revert to earlier versions when necessary.

There are two main types:

1. **Centralized VCS (e.g., Subversion/SVN)** – A single central server holds the code base, and users pull and commit changes directly to it.

2. **Distributed VCS (e.g., Git)** – Every user has a full copy of the repository, enabling offline work and greater flexibility.

## Key benefits of VCS:

- Tracks changes and history.

- Facilitates collaboration.

- Enables branching and merging.

- Helps prevent data loss.

Git is the most widely used VCS today, especially in software development.
