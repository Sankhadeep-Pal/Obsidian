|`<a href="...">`|Anchor tags with descriptive text improve navigation and keyword relevance.|
|`<img alt="...">`|`alt` attributes help with image SEO and accessibility. Use meaningful descriptions.|
|`<strong>`, `<em>`|These tags give importance to text (e.g., keywords), which can influence SEO slightly.|

## ✅ **Best SEO Practices in HTML**

1. **Use semantic HTML** (like `<article>`, `<section>`, `<nav>`) to improve structure and clarity.

2. **Include relevant keywords** in titles, headings, and throughout the content—naturally.

3. **Optimize images** with `alt` attributes and proper file names.

4. **Create clean, readable URLs** and use proper internal linking.

5. **Use schema markup** (structured data) to help search engines better understand your content (e.g., for reviews, recipes, articles).
