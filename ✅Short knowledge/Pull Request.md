# Pull Request

A **pull request (PR)** is a method used in collaborative software development—especially with **Git** and platforms like **GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket**—to propose changes to a codebase.

### What Is a Pull Request?

A **pull request** occurs when a developer:

1. **Creates a new branch** from the main project.

2. **Makes changes** to the code in that branch.
 
3. **Pushes the changes** to a remote repository.

4. **Submits a pull request** to merge those changes into another branch (typically `main` or `develop`).

### Why Is It Called a “Pull” Request?

Because you’re **requesting the maintainer** of the target branch to **pull your changes** into their branch.

### Common Workflow:

1. **Fork or branch** the main repo.

2. **Make and commit** changes locally.

3. **Push** your branch to the remote repository.

4. **Create a pull request** via the platform’s interface.

5. **Wait for code review** and make any required updates.

6. **Once approved**, the pull request is **merged** into the base branch.

### Benefits:

- Code review before merging.

- Collaboration and discussion around changes.

- Maintains code quality and consistency.

- Tracks changes for future reference.
