# Integrated Development Environment

An **Integrated Development Environment (IDE)** is a software application that provides comprehensive tools for software development within a single interface. IDEs are designed to streamline the development process by integrating various tools developers need in one place.

### Core Features of an IDE:

1. **Source Code Editor**: A text editor optimized for writing and editing code, often with syntax highlighting, code completion, and error detection.
 
2. **Compiler and/or Interpreter**: Translates code into a runnable program or executes it line-by-line.

3. **Debugger**: Helps in finding and fixing bugs by allowing developers to inspect code behavior during execution.

4. **Build Automation Tools**: Assist with compiling code, managing dependencies, and packaging applications.

5. **Version Control Integration**: Connects with systems like Git to manage code revisions and collaboration.

6. **Project Management Tools**: Allows organization of files, libraries, and configurations within a project.
