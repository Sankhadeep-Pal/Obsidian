Modern physics

1. Photoelectric effect

Def = It is the phenomenon where electron get released from the surface of material when light or any kind of electromagnetic radiation with sufficient frequency incident on it.

Discovered by - 
Explained by - Albert Einstein (1905), reworded with Noble prize (1915)

Observations - 
1. Threshold frequency = the photoelectric emission occurs when the frequency of incident EMW is above of certain value (which defers material to material). Any amount of intensity doesn't trigger the emission, this boundary frequency is called Threshold frequency
2. Work function = the electrons start to emit only if they absorb a minimum amount of energy for photon of EMW, that threshold energy is called work function. It varies material to material and work func = plank constant * threshold freq
3. Maximum K.E. = maximum K.E. of emitted electrons is directly proportional to the frequency of EMW.
4. Intensity = Intensity of incident light means the number of photon in unit area, so when we increase the intensity of EMW with a frequency above threshold, then the amount of photon increases which cause more electron to emit, in this way the photoelectric current increases. But, the KE of individual electron is still same Because it depends on frequency not intensity.
5. Instantaneous emission = there is no delay b/w incidenting EMR and electron emission, this proves particle nature of light. If light is wave then to absorb the energy will take some time, but in practice there is no delay.

Einstein Equation => E(photon) = hv
	hv = work function + K.E.(max)
	hv = fai + (1/2)m(v(max))^2
	hv = fai + eV(0)
	hv = hv(0) + K.E.(max)

Stopping potential (V(0)) = The minimum reverse electrical potential that we have to apply in order to stop photoelectric current flowing is called Stopping potential.
